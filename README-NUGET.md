# NeoIni

NeoIni is a fully-featured C# library for working with INI files that provides secure, thread-safe read/write configuration with built-in integrity checking (checksum) and optional AES encryption.

## Installation

```bash
dotnet add package NeoIni
```

- **Package:** [nuget.org/packages/NeoIni](https://www.nuget.org/packages/NeoIni)
- **Version:** `1.5.7.2` | **.NET 6+**
- **Developer:** [Lonewolf239](https://github.com/Lonewolf239)

## Features

- **Typed Get**: read values as `bool`, `int`, `double`, `DateTime`, `enum`, `string` and others with automatic parsing and defaults.
- **AutoAdd**: when reading via `GetValue<T>`, missing keys/sections can be automatically created with a default value.
- **Thread-safe**: uses `ReaderWriterLockSlim` for safe access from multiple threads.
- **AutoSave**: automatic saving after changes or at intervals (`UseAutoSaveInterval`, `AutoSaveInterval`).
- **AutoBackup**: creates a `.backup` file when saving to protect against corruption.
- **Checksum**: built-in SHA256 checksum validation to detect corruption/tampering.
- **Optional AES-256 encryption**: transparent file-level encryption with IV and key bound to user environment or custom password.
- **Full async API**: asynchronous versions for most operations (`GetValueAsync`, `SetKeyAsync`, `SaveFileAsync`, `ReloadFromFileAsync`, etc.).
- **Convenient API**: for managing sections and keys (create, rename, search, clear, delete).
- **Events**: hooks for saving, loading, key/section changes, autosave, errors, checksum mismatches, and search completion.
- **Easy migration**: transfer encrypted configs between machines via `GetEncryptionPassword()` with auto-encryption.

## Security Features

- **Checksum (SHA256)**: when saving, an 8-byte checksum computed via SHA256 is appended to file contents; when reading it is verified, and if mismatched, you can handle the `OnChecksumMismatch` event or fall back to `.backup`.
- **AES-256**: when encryption is enabled, data is encrypted with AES using a 16-byte IV and 32-byte key generated from user environment or a custom password.
- **Environment-based key**: by default, the key is deterministically generated from `Environment.UserName`, `Environment.MachineName`, and `Environment.UserDomainName`, making the file unreadable on another host without a special password.
- **Backup fallback**: on read errors, corruption, or decryption errors, the library can automatically attempt to read the `.backup` file.
- **Thread-safe access**: all read/write operations are wrapped in `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, preventing races under high load.

## Quick Start

### Creating a NeoIniReader Instance

```csharp
using NeoIni;

NeoIniReader reader = new("config.ini");                             // No encryption
NeoIniReader encryptedReader = new("config.ini", true);              // Auto-encryption by environment
NeoIniReader customEncrypted = new("config.ini", "MySecretPas123");  // Encryption with custom password
```

- When `autoEncryption = true`, the key is generated automatically and bound to the user/machine.
- When an `encryptionPassword` is provided, the key is deterministically derived from that password, which is useful for transferring configs between machines.

### Reading Values

```csharp
string text = reader.GetValue<string>("Section1", "Key1", "default");
int number = reader.GetValue<int>("Section1", "Number", 0);
bool flag = reader.GetValue<bool>("Section1", "Enabled", false);
double value = reader.GetValue<double>("Section1", "Value", 0.0);
DateTime when = reader.GetValue<DateTime>("Log", "LastRun", DateTime.Now);
```

- If a section/key is missing, `defaultValue` is returned; with `AutoAdd` enabled, the key may be created in the file.
- Reading `enum` and `DateTime` is supported via `Convert.ChangeType`/`Enum.TryParse`/`DateTime.TryParse` (invariant culture).

### Writing Values

```csharp
reader.SetKey("Section1", "Key1", "Value1");
reader.SetKey("Section1", "Number", 42);
reader.SetKey("Section1", "Enabled", true);
reader.SetKey("Section1", "LastUpdate", DateTime.Now);
```

- If a section/key doesn't exist, it will be created; changes trigger `OnKeyAdded`/`OnKeyChanged` events if needed and may trigger autosave.

## Example

```csharp
using NeoIni;

using NeoIniReader reader = new("config.ini");

// Initialize database settings
reader.SetKey("Database", "Host", "localhost");
reader.SetKey("Database", "Port", 5432);
reader.SetKey("Settings", "AutoSave", true);

// Read
string host = reader.GetValue<string>("Database", "Host", "127.0.0.1");
int port = reader.GetValue<int>("Database", "Port", 3306);

Console.WriteLine($"DB: {host}:{port}");
```

- In this example, on first run the file is created; on subsequent runs, values are simply read and updated.

### Section/Key Management

```csharp
// Checks
bool sectionExists = reader.SectionExists("Section1");
bool keyExists = reader.KeyExists("Section1", "Key1");

// Create/delete
reader.AddSection("NewSection");
reader.RemoveKey("Section1", "Key1");
reader.RemoveSection("Section1");

// Get lists
string[] sections = reader.GetAllSections();
string[] keys = reader.GetAllKeys("NewSection");

// Clear
reader.ClearSection("NewSection");
```

- Section/key management methods are available in both sync and async variants (`AddSectionAsync`, `RemoveKeyAsync`, `RenameSectionAsync`, etc.).

### File Operations

```csharp
// Explicit save
reader.SaveFile();
await reader.SaveFileAsync();

// Reload data from disk
reader.ReloadFromFile();
await reader.ReloadFromFileAsync();

// Delete file
reader.DeleteFile();                // file only
reader.DeleteFileWithData();        // file + clear Data
```

- When saving, an intermediate `.tmp` file is used, and if `AutoBackup` is enabled, a `.backup` is created before atomic replacement.

### Options

```csharp
reader.AutoSave = true;             // enable autosave
reader.AutoSaveInterval = 3;        // save not every change, but every 3 operations

reader.AutoBackup = true;           // enable .backup
reader.AutoAdd = true;              // auto-create keys on GetValue
reader.UseChecksum = true;          // enable checksum
```

### Events (Callbacks)

```csharp
reader.OnSave += () => Console.WriteLine("Saved");
reader.OnLoad += () => Console.WriteLine("Loaded");

reader.OnKeyChanged += (section, key, value) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"[{section}] {key} changed to {value}");

reader.OnKeyAdded += (section, key, value) =>
    Console.WriteLine($"[{section}] {key} added: {value}");

reader.OnSectionAdded += section =>
    Console.WriteLine($"Section added: {section}");

reader.OnChecksumMismatch += (expected, actual) =>
    Console.WriteLine("Checksum mismatch detected!");

reader.OnError += ex =>
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
```

### Search

```csharp
var results = reader.Search("token");
foreach (var (section, key, value) in results)
    Console.WriteLine($"[{section}] {key} = {value}");
```

- Search is performed on keys and values (case-insensitive); result is a list of tuples `(section, key, value)`. After search, `OnSearchCompleted` is called with the pattern and match count.

### Encryption & Migration

#### Auto-encryption (machine-bound)

```csharp
NeoIniReader reader = new("secure.ini", autoEncryption: true);
```

- The key is deterministically generated from the current user/machine/domain, so the file cannot be read on another machine without knowing the generated password.

To migrate to another machine, you can retrieve the password:

```csharp
string password = reader.GetEncryptionPassword();
// Save securely somewhere and use on the new machine
```

On the new machine:

```csharp
NeoIniReader migrated = new("secure.ini", password);
```

- If a custom password was used (`NeoIniReader(path, "secret")`), `GetEncryptionPassword()` will return a status without revealing the password.

### Disposal & Lifetime

```csharp
using NeoIniReader reader = new("config.ini");
// working with reader
// on exiting using block:
//  - SaveFile() is called
//  - data is cleared and resources are freed
```

- In `Dispose(bool)`, `SaveFile` is called (with exception suppression), internal `Data` is cleared, and `ReaderWriterLockSlim` is freed; after that the object is considered released.

## Philosophy

**Black Box Design**: all internal logic is hidden behind the simple public API of the `NeoIniReader` class. You work only with methods and events, without thinking about implementation details.
